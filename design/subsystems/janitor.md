# Janitor standing consent

A standing approval records a person's consent for bounded routine updates. It
is separate from a vote on an individual Change. AppTown records the exact
meaning, project UUIDs, workflow purposes, selected environment and target UUIDs,
and the person who enabled it. Changes create new revisions; history is retained.

Automatic processing is not available. Saving consent does not update, accept,
land or deploy software. No existing approval or imported rule enables it.

The project’s Janitor page previews the exact consent before saving. Full delivery
requires explicit environments for every selected project, deployment authority
and promotion consent where required. Nothing selects a default environment on
the person's behalf. “Accept and land only” explicitly leaves running software
unchanged. Administrative rules cover a finite captured project set; they do not
expand to later projects.

Only a verified person acting directly in their browser or personal command-line
instrument can enable or revise consent. Management, approval, landing and
release permissions remain distinct. Current project law and approval selectors
apply; unsupported quorums and independent-approval requirements refuse setup.
The working and landing workflow each declare one supported purpose with
`standing: {class: routine-update, means: ...}` on their approval step. This
declaration provides no authority and changes no ordinary human vote.

A rule names bounded patch/minor dependencies, verified same-version base-image
updates, security fixes within those limits, or governed routine way-of-working
transitions. Application source, migrations, major versions, new capabilities,
needs or secrets, weaker checks, unsupported changes and storage-engine
transitions require a person. Missing or nonpassing evidence is never success.

The enabling principal is recorded by UUID. A renamed person retains identity;
a new account with the old name cannot inherit consent. Current eligibility is
shown separately from enabled state. Database or policy unavailability is an
error, not an eligible rule. Disabling retains history and stops future claims;
an external effect already claimed may finish. A manager can disable consent
after the issuer loses deployment permission.

Supported instance restore disables every enabled imported rule after schema
migration and before application recovery. Original consent remains in history.
Re-enabling requires a new local human confirmation. There is no standing-rule
import endpoint.

The CLI provides `apptown janitor list`, `preview`, `enable`, `disable` and
`history`. Preview accepts a definition through `--file`; enable requires the
exact returned `--confirm` digest. Revising requires `--rule` and `--revision`.
Disable also requires the expected revision. Commands emit JSON and never start
a release. If a save response is lost, inspect current rules before submitting
another new rule; an unknown response is not proof the save failed.
